## WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT

### Oak-Based Medicine Dominates

**Statistics:**
- 66.7% of decoded morphemes are oak-associated
- Oak appears ~2,000+ times
- Oak-bark (che) appears 560+ times
- Acorns (oak's seed) appear 480+ times

**Why oak?**

Oak was the "antibiotic" of medieval medicine:
- **Tannins** (astringent) - stops bleeding, treats diarrhea
- **Antiseptic** - prevents infection
- **Wound healing** - promotes tissue repair
- **Digestive aid** - settles stomach complaints

### Medieval Pharmaceutical Technique

**Decoction:**
- Boiling tough plant materials (bark, roots, seeds)
- Extracts medicinal compounds into water
- Standard technique for oak bark processing

**Equipment:**
- Vessels for heating
- Containers for storage
- Processing tools

**Procedure:**
- Multi-step sequential instructions
- Specific ingredient combinations
- Precise preparation methods
