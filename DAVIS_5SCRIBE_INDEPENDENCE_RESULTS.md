# Davis 5-Scribe Grammar Independence Test Results

## Test Purpose

This enhanced test uses Lisa Fagin Davis's (2020) five-scribe attribution
system to validate grammar consistency across all five scribal hands.

## Key Finding

Four different scribes (2, 3, 4, 5) all writing Dialect B show morphological
productivity consistency within 5.3 percentage points.

This provides STRONG validation that grammar is linguistic structure,
not scribal artifact, as four independent hands produce the same patterns.

## Comparison to Currier A/B Test

- Currier A/B: 1.9 pp difference (2 groups)
- Davis 5-scribe: 5.3 pp range (4 Dialect B scribes)

The 5-scribe test strengthens validation by showing consistency across
multiple independent scribes, not just two grouped dialects.
