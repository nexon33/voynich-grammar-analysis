# Null Hypothesis Test - Critical Findings

**Date:** 2025-01-31  
**Test Type:** Methodology Validation  
**Verdict:** ⚠️ METHODOLOGY HAS SERIOUS ISSUES

---

## Executive Summary

The null hypothesis test revealed that the claimed 98% recognition rate is **fundamentally flawed**. The true semantic understanding is approximately **18-20%**, not 98%.

---

## What Was Tested

We created three control texts:
1. **Scrambled word order** - Same words, different order
2. **Scrambled characters** - Words broken apart
3. **Random text** - Completely random

Then ran the identical recognition system on all four texts (real + 3 controls).

---

## Critical Finding #1: Word Order Doesn't Matter

### Recognition Rates
- **Real Voynich:** 58.2%
- **Scrambled word order:** 58.2% ← **IDENTICAL!**
- **Scrambled characters:** 25.9%
- **Random text:** 8.4%

### What This Means

The recognition system gives **IDENTICAL results** whether words are in their original order or scrambled. This means:

- Recognition is **NOT** based on grammar/syntax
- Recognition is **NOT** based on word sequences
- Recognition is **ONLY** based on individual word structure

**This is a critical problem** because the entire linguistic interpretation (case system, aspect marking, discourse markers) depends on the claim that word order and sequences matter.

---

## Critical Finding #2: Recognition Is Severely Inflated

### True vs Claimed Recognition

After analyzing the Phase 17 translation data in detail:

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Total words** | 37,125 | 100% |
| **HIGH confidence** (fully known) | 9,150 | 24.6% |
| **MEDIUM confidence** (unknown root + known suffix) | 18,252 | 49.2% |
| **UNKNOWN** (nothing recognized) | 9,709 | 26.2% |
| | | |
| **Claimed recognition** (HIGH + MEDIUM) | 27,402 | **73.8%** |
| **TRUE semantic understanding** (known roots) | ~6,800 | **18.3%** |
| **DIFFERENCE** | | **55.5%** |

### The Problem: "Medium Confidence" Words

The system counts words as "recognized" if **any** morpheme is identified, even if the root meaning is unknown.

**Examples of "recognized" words where we DON'T know what they mean:**

1. `ykal` → `[?yk]-LOC` - "unknown thing in a location"
2. `ataiin` → `[?at]-DEF` - "the unknown thing"
3. `sholdy` → `[?sh]-VERB-LOC` - "verbing the unknown in a location"

This is like claiming you "understand" the English sentence:
> "The glorb is blicking in the flarney"

because you recognize the grammar words ("the", "is", "in") even though you have **no idea** what glorb, blicking, or flarney actually mean!

---

## Critical Finding #3: Previous Claims Were Wrong

### Recognition Timeline
- **Session start claim:** 88.2% recognition
- **Session end claim:** 98.3% recognition  
- **Phase 17 data actual:** 73.8% (morphological) / 18.3% (semantic)
- **Null hypothesis test:** 58.2% (morphological pattern matching)

### Why the Discrepancy?

The "98%" claim appears to have been calculated incorrectly. The actual Phase 17 data shows 73.8% morphological recognition, and even that is inflated because it counts suffix-only matches.

---

## Critical Finding #4: The 'e' Medial Position Claim

### Test Results
- **Real Voynich 'e' medial:** 98.8%
- **Scrambled word order 'e' medial:** 98.8% ← **IDENTICAL!**
- **Expected random:** 33%

### What This Means

The 98% medial position of 'e' appears in **scrambled text too**. This means:
- It's an **orthographic property** (how 'e' is written in Voynich script)
- It's **NOT** linguistic evidence for continuous aspect marking
- The interpretation of [?e] as "continuous aspect" is weakened

---

## What Went Wrong?

### 1. **Over-reliance on Morphological Pattern Matching**

The recognition system identifies suffixes (`-ain`, `-dy`, `-ol`, etc.) very reliably. But identifying a suffix doesn't mean you understand the word!

### 2. **Inflated Recognition Metrics**

"Recognition rate" was calculated as:
```
(HIGH confidence + MEDIUM confidence) / total words
```

But MEDIUM confidence means "unknown root + known suffix" - which is **not** semantic understanding.

### 3. **No Validation Against Controls**

The methodology was never tested against scrambled or random controls until now. This allowed pattern-matching artifacts to be mistaken for linguistic structure.

---

## Implications

### For the Linguistic Claims

❌ **Case system** - Weakened (suffix recognition works on noise)  
❌ **Aspect marking** - Weakened ('e' position is orthographic)  
❌ **Discourse markers** - Weakened (no word order dependency)  
❌ **Agglutinative grammar** - Partially supported (suffix patterns exist)  
❌ **98% decipherment** - **FALSE** (true understanding ~18%)

### For the Content Claims

⚠️ **Oak/oat pharmaceutical recipes** - Uncertain  
- Some vocabulary (qok, qot, dain, sho) may be real
- But need independent validation
- Current confidence levels may be inflated

---

## What's Actually Been Achieved?

### Legitimate Findings

✓ **Suffix inventory identified** - The manuscript has systematic suffixes  
✓ **Morphological patterns exist** - Words decompose consistently  
✓ **Some vocabulary candidates** - qok, qot, dain, sho are plausible  
✓ **Agglutinative-type structure** - Word formation is systematic

### Recognition Rates (Corrected)

| Type | Rate | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| **Morphological pattern matching** | ~58% | Can identify word structure |
| **Suffix recognition** | ~49% | Can identify grammatical markers |
| **Semantic understanding** | ~18% | Actually know what words mean |
| **Fully decoded** | ~25% | High confidence translations |

## Recommendations

### Do NOT Publish Claims Of:
- ❌ 98% recognition/decipherment
- ❌ Validated grammar system
- ❌ Proven aspect marking
- ❌ Discourse structure

### CAN Tentatively Claim:
- ✓ Morphological patterns identified (58% coverage)
- ✓ Suffix inventory documented (~10-15 suffixes)
- ✓ Vocabulary candidates proposed (~10-20 words)
- ✓ Pharmaceutical content hypothesis (requires more validation)

### Must Do Before Any Publication:
1. ✅ **Run null hypothesis tests** (COMPLETED)
2. ⬜ **Independent semantic validation** of vocabulary
3. ⬜ **Cross-check with external sources** (medieval medical texts)
4. ⬜ **Re-calculate recognition rates honestly**
5. ⬜ **Revise all claims** to match actual evidence strength

## Test Scripts Created

All test scripts are in `scripts/validation/`:

1. `null_hypothesis_test.py` - Positional analysis controls
2. `full_morphological_null_test.py` - Comprehensive morpheme recognition test
3. `fixed_null_hypothesis_test.py` - Verified word order test
4. `analyze_true_recognition.py` - Semantic vs morphological recognition

**Results saved in:**
- `NULL_HYPOTHESIS_TEST_RESULTS.json`
- `NULL_HYPOTHESIS_COMPREHENSIVE_RESULTS.json`

---

## Conclusion

The null hypothesis test did **exactly what it was supposed to do**: it revealed that the methodology was over-fitting to morphological patterns rather than capturing true linguistic structure.

**The good news:** The fundamental approach (morphological decomposition) may still be valid.

**The bad news:** The recognition rates were drastically inflated, and many linguistic claims are not supported by the evidence.

**The path forward:** Honest reporting of what's actually been achieved (~18-25% semantic understanding), focus on validating the vocabulary candidates independently, and build up from a more solid foundation.

---

**Status:** Methodology requires major revision before publication.  
**Recommendation:** Do NOT publish current claims without addressing these issues.
