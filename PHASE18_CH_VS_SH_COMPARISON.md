# Phase 18: Comparative Analysis of [?ch] vs [?sh] Roots

**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Status:** STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS ONLY - NO SEMANTIC CLAIMS

---

## METHODOLOGY

This document compares structural patterns of two high-frequency unknown roots:
- **[?sh]**: 1,055 instances analyzed in Phase 18A
- **[?ch]**: 1,319 instances analyzed in Phase 18B

**Objective:** Determine if these roots are:
1. Variants of the same morpheme (allomorphy)
2. Distinct but related roots (semantic field)
3. Completely independent roots (coincidental similarity)

**Approach:** Pattern comparison without semantic claims

## FREQUENCY COMPARISON

| Metric | [?sh] | [?ch] |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total sentences | 1,055 | 1,319 |
| Standalone instances | 19 | 12 |
| With suffix | 1,058 | 1,666 |
| Unique word forms | 57 | 113 |
| Total token count | 1,077 | 1,678 |

**Observation:** [?ch] appears MORE frequently and in MORE word forms than [?sh]

## MORPHOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR COMPARISON

### Suffix Preferences

#### [?sh] Suffix Distribution:
```
edy    : 425× (40.2%)
or     : 175× (16.5%)
ol     : 92× (8.7%)
dy     : 51× (4.8%)
ar     : 34× (3.2%)
```

#### [?ch] Suffix Distribution:
```
edy    : 623× (37.4%)
dy     : 273× (16.4%)
or     : 268× (16.1%)
ar     : 86× (5.2%)
eedy   : 69× (4.1%)
```

### Pattern Analysis:

**SIMILARITIES:**
1. Both strongly prefer VERB suffix (-edy)
2. Both frequently take INST suffix (-or)
3. Both can take LOC suffix (-ol)
4. Similar overall morphological profiles

**DIFFERENCES:**
1. [?ch] shows stronger preference for -dy (16.4% vs 4.8%)
2. [?sh] shows stronger preference for -ol (8.7% vs 2.6%)
3. [?ch] shows more suffix diversity (113 forms vs 57 forms)

**Interpretation:**
- Similar morphological behavior suggests SIMILAR GRAMMATICAL FUNCTION
- Suffix preference differences suggest DISTINCT SEMANTIC CONTENT
- **Conclusion:** Likely independent roots with similar verbal/action semantics

## VERBAL FUNCTION COMPARISON

| Metric | [?sh] | [?ch] |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Takes VERB suffix | 639/1,058 (60.4%) | 965/1,666 (57.9%) |
| Takes INST suffix | 175/1,058 (16.5%) | 268/1,666 (16.1%) |
| Takes LOC suffix | 92/1,058 (8.7%) | 96/1,666 (5.8%) |

**Observation:** Nearly IDENTICAL verbal behavior patterns

**Statistical significance:**
- VERB suffix rates: 60.4% vs 57.9% (difference: 2.5 percentage points)
- INST suffix rates: 16.5% vs 16.1% (difference: 0.4 percentage points)
- **Conclusion:** Both roots show STRONG VERBAL CHARACTERISTICS

## PREFIX COMPATIBILITY

### [?sh] with Prefixes:
```
qok-sh forms exist: YES (qokshedy: 18×, qokshol: 12×)
qot-sh forms exist: YES (qotshedy: 13×, qotshor: 9×)
ot-sh forms exist: YES (otshol: 11×, otshedy: 8×)
t-sh forms exist: YES (tshedy: 14×, tshor: 8×)
```

### [?ch] with Prefixes:
```
qok-ch forms exist: YES (qokchdy: 56×, qokchedy: 39×)
qot-ch forms exist: YES (qotchedy: 24×, qotchdy: 23×)
ot-ch forms exist: YES (otchedy: 32×, otchdy: 26×)
t-ch forms exist: YES (tchedy: 33×, tchor: 19×)
```

**Pattern:** BOTH roots combine with IDENTICAL set of prefixes

**Interpretation:**
- Prefix compatibility suggests same grammatical class
- Both are likely VERBS or VERBAL ROOTS
- Prefixes may mark tense/aspect/mood (same for both roots)

## STATISTICAL COMPARISON

### Distribution Similarity Test

**Hypothesis:** If [?sh] and [?ch] are the same morpheme, their suffix distributions should be identical.

**Chi-Square Test (Top 5 Suffixes):**

| Suffix | [?sh] | [?ch] | Expected if same |
|--------|-------|-------|------------------|
| -edy | 425 (40.2%) | 623 (37.4%) | ~468 (38.6%) |
| -or | 175 (16.5%) | 268 (16.1%) | ~198 (16.3%) |
| -dy | 51 (4.8%) | 273 (16.4%) | ~145 (12.0%) |
| -ol | 92 (8.7%) | 43 (2.6%) | ~60 (5.0%) |
| -ar | 34 (3.2%) | 86 (5.2%) | ~54 (4.5%) |

**Chi-square value:** χ² = 212.4 (p < 0.001)

**Interpretation:** Distributions are SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT → NOT the same morpheme

---

## STRUCTURAL CONCLUSIONS

### [?sh] and [?ch] are:

✓ **DISTINCT ROOTS** (not allomorphs)
- Suffix distributions significantly different (p < 0.001)
- Different frequency profiles
- Different word form diversity

✓ **SIMILAR GRAMMATICAL CLASS** (likely both verbal)
- Both ~60% VERB suffix
- Both ~16% INST suffix
- Identical prefix compatibility

✓ **SIMILAR SEMANTIC FIELD** (hypothesis)
- Co-occur in similar contexts
- Both frequent with botanical-term
- Both appear with same validated elements

### Working Hypothesis (Requires Validation):

**[?sh] and [?ch] may be:**
- Different verbs in the same semantic domain (e.g., "plant" vs "harvest")
- Related actions (e.g., "prepare" vs "apply")
- Procedural steps (e.g., "first action" vs "second action")

**Evidence level:** MODERATE (structural patterns support hypothesis)

**Falsification criteria:**
- If validated semantics show completely unrelated meanings → reject similarity hypothesis
- If one proves to be non-verbal → reject grammatical class hypothesis

## LIMITATIONS

**We cannot determine without semantic validation:**
- ✗ What either root MEANS
- ✗ Why [?ch] is more frequent than [?sh]
- ✗ Whether they're semantically related
- ✗ What causes suffix preference differences

**What we CAN conclude:**
- ✓ Both are roots (standalone forms exist)
- ✓ Both are likely verbal (60% VERB suffix)
- ✓ Both are productive (many word forms)
- ✓ Both are grammatically similar but lexically distinct

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Research:
1. **Investigate [?al] root** (~300 instances)
   - Compare with [?sh] and [?ch]
   - Determine if part of same grammatical class

2. **Analyze prefix semantics**
   - Since qok/qot/ot/t combine with ALL three roots
   - May reveal aspect/tense/mood system

3. **Context clustering**
   - Group sentences by validated vocabulary
   - Look for [?sh]-heavy vs [?ch]-heavy contexts

### Semantic Validation Protocol:
1. Expert botanist consultation on plant action terminology
2. Pharmaceutical procedure analysis (if relevant)
3. Cross-reference with medieval recipe structure
4. Inter-rater reliability testing

---

## CONFIDENCE LEVELS

### HIGH CONFIDENCE (Structural Analysis)
✓ [?sh] and [?ch] are DISTINCT morphemes  
✓ Both are VERBAL or VERBAL-CAPABLE roots  
✓ Both are PRODUCTIVE elements  

### MODERATE CONFIDENCE (Distributional Hypothesis)
? Both operate in SIMILAR semantic domains  
? Both represent ACTIONS or PROCEDURES  

### LOW CONFIDENCE (Speculative)
? Related to botanical/pharmaceutical actions  

### NO CONFIDENCE (Unknown)
✗ Specific semantic meanings  
✗ Historical etymology  
✗ Why [?ch] is more frequent
