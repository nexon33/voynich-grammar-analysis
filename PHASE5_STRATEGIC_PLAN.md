# PHASE 5 STRATEGIC PLAN

**Goal:** Determine if statistical methods can overcome the function word bottleneck

**Timeline:** 5 days (strategic validation + decision point)

**Decision Criteria:** Clear success/failure metrics for continuing vs. documenting

---

## The Strategic Approach

### Why This Is Different from Phase 4

**Phase 4 approach:** 
- Validated any high-quality noun candidates
- Hoped more vocabulary would help translation

**Phase 5 approach:**
- **Target the specific words blocking our test sentences**
- Get immediate diagnostic feedback
- Know within days if we can proceed

### The Blocking Words

From translation attempts, these HIGH-FREQUENCY words prevent interpretation:

**Sentence 2 blockers:**
- qol, qokchy, ory, ldaiin, sal

**Sentence 3 blockers:**  
- p!shorol, shckhy, qokaldy, opchedy, saral

**Sentence 4 blockers:**
- qokai!n, checkhy, cheey, chey, dai!n

**Sentence 5 blockers:**
- qokal, dyty, s!aiin, ol, lchey, shai!n

### Priority Targets (8 words)

Selected based on:
1. Appear in multiple failed sentences
2. High frequency
3. Not obviously grammatical morphemes

**Tier 1 (Critical):**
1. **qol** - appears in sentences 2, 4 (high frequency)
2. **ory** - appears in sentence 2 (15.8x enriched in earlier analysis)
3. **sal** - appears in sentence 2
4. **dai!n** - appears in sentence 4 (might be pronoun variant?)

**Tier 2 (Important):**
5. **chey** - appears in sentence 4
6. **dyty** - appears in sentence 5
7. **ldaiin** - appears in sentence 2
8. **s!aiin** - appears in sentence 5 (might be pronoun variant?)

---

## Validation Protocol

### For Each Target Word:

**Run 8/8 Evidence Scoring:**

1. **Co-occurrence test** (0-2 points)
   - With validated nouns (oak, oat, water, red, cho, cheo)
   - Rate > 15% = 2 points, > 10% = 1 point

2. **Section enrichment** (0-2 points)
   - Max enrichment > 2.5x = 2 points, > 2.0x = 1 point

3. **Case-marking rate** (0-2 points)
   - > 50% = 2 points, > 35% = 1 point

4. **Verbal rate** (0-2 points)
   - < 5% = 2 points, < 15% = 1 point

**Score interpretation:**
- **6-8 points:** Validated noun → add to vocabulary
- **4-5 points:** Possible noun → investigate further
- **0-3 points:** Likely function word → cannot decode with current methods

## Decision Tree

### Day 1-3: Validate 8 Target Words

**Outcome A: 5-6 validate as nouns (6+ score)**
- → Excellent! Specific semantic blockers identified
- → Proceed immediately to Day 4 re-translation
- → Expected result: 3-4/5 sentences coherent

**Outcome B: 2-4 validate as nouns**
- → Mixed evidence
- → Some semantic blockers, some function words
- → Proceed to Day 4 re-translation
- → Expected result: 2-3/5 sentences coherent
- → Reassess based on improvement

**Outcome C: 0-1 validate as nouns**
- → Function word bottleneck confirmed
- → Statistical methods have hit ceiling
- → Skip to Day 5 decision: Document findings
- → Do not spend more time on validation

### Day 4: Re-Translation Test

**With expanded vocabulary, re-translate 5 test sentences**

**Measure:**
- How many sentences become coherent?
- What % of words are now recognized?
- Are interpretations consistent with medieval recipes?

### Day 5: Final Decision Point

**Clear Success (4-5/5 coherent):**
- ✓ Function words interpretable from context
- ✓ Vocabulary coverage is sufficient
- → **Action:** Continue to Phase 6 (full folio translation)
- → **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for complete f84v translation

**Partial Success (2-3/5 coherent):**
- ✓ Significant progress but still limited
- ~ Function word gap partially bridged
- → **Action:** One more targeted expansion (5-10 more terms)
- → **Timeline:** 1 week expansion + re-test
- → **Decision criteria:** Must reach 4/5 coherent or stop

**No Improvement (still 1/5 coherent):**
- ✗ Statistical methods cannot overcome function word bottleneck
- ✗ More vocabulary doesn't help without syntax knowledge
- → **Action:** Pivot to comprehensive documentation (Phase 5B)
- → **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for publication-ready analysis

## Phase 5B: Comprehensive Documentation (if needed)

### If We Hit the Ceiling

**Goal:** Document validated findings as publishable linguistic research

**Deliverables:**

1. **Complete Grammatical Analysis**
   - Full case system documentation
   - Verbal derivation patterns
   - Morphological rules catalog
   - Genitive system analysis

2. **Validated Vocabulary Catalog**
   - All validated terms with evidence scores
   - Etymology notes (where applicable)
   - Usage patterns and frequencies
   - Semantic field mappings

3. **Word Class Taxonomy**
   - Nominal roots (case-marking profiles)
   - Verbal roots (derivational patterns)
   - Polysemous roots (multiple functions)
   - Function words (identified but not decoded)

4. **Section Analysis**
   - Content topics by manuscript section
   - Specialized vocabulary distributions
   - Illustration correlations

5. **Methodological Documentation**
   - Statistical validation protocols
   - Evidence scoring system
   - Reproducible analysis scripts

6. **Limitations Analysis**
   - What can be achieved with statistical methods
   - What cannot (the function word bottleneck)
   - Requirements for further progress

**Output Format:** Publication-ready manuscript + supplementary data

**Target Venue:** 
- Computational linguistics journal
- Historical linguistics journal
- Voynich research community

**Value:** 
- First rigorously validated linguistic analysis of Voynich
- Documents ceiling of statistical decipherment methods
- Provides infrastructure for future breakthroughs

## Success Criteria Summary

### Phase 5A Success (Continue Translation)
- 4-5/5 sentences coherent with expanded vocabulary
- Function words interpretable from context
- Path to full translation clear

### Phase 5A Partial (One More Round)
- 2-3/5 sentences coherent
- Noticeable improvement from baseline
- Justified to try one more expansion

### Phase 5A Failure (Pivot to Documentation)
- Still 1/5 sentences coherent
- OR 0-1 blocking words validate as nouns
- Statistical ceiling confirmed

---

## Why This Approach Is Scientifically Sound

### Testable Hypothesis
"If blocking words are semantic (nouns/verbs), then validating them enables translation. If they're syntactic (function words), translation remains blocked."

### Clear Metrics
- Noun validation: 6+/8 evidence score
- Translation success: 4+/5 coherent sentences
- Improvement threshold: +2 coherent sentences from baseline

### Defined Timeline
- 5 days to decision point
- No open-ended searching
- Clear stop conditions

### Valuable Either Way

**If successful:**
- Breakthrough to translation capability
- Validates statistical methodology
- Demonstrates language is decipherable

**If unsuccessful:**
- Documents limitations of statistical methods
- Identifies function word bottleneck
- Produces publishable research on partial decipherment

---

## Resources Required

### Scripts to Create
1. Batch validation script (test 8 words efficiently)
2. Enhanced translation script (with expanded vocabulary)
3. Coherence scoring script (objective metrics)

### Time Investment
- Days 1-3: 4-6 hours (validation)
- Day 4: 2-3 hours (translation test)
- Day 5: 1-2 hours (decision and planning)
- **Total: ~15 hours over 5 days**

### If Proceeding to Phase 5B
- Weeks 1-3: 20-30 hours (comprehensive documentation)
- **Output: Publication-ready manuscript**

## Expected Outcomes (Honest Probability Assessment)

### Scenario Probabilities

**Outcome A: Clear success (4-5/5 coherent)**
- Probability: 15-25%
- Requires: Most blocking words are nouns
- Would mean: Breakthrough is achievable

**Outcome B: Partial success (2-3/5 coherent)**
- Probability: 30-40%
- Requires: Some blockers are nouns, some are function words
- Would mean: Close but need more work

**Outcome C: No improvement (1/5 coherent)**
- Probability: 40-50%
- Requires: Most blockers are function words
- Would mean: Statistical ceiling confirmed

**Most likely:** Outcome B or C (70-90% combined)

This suggests we should be **prepared for documentation** but **attempt one more strategic push first**.

## The Meta-Goal

**Determine with scientific rigor whether statistical methods can decode Voynich manuscript.**

**Possible findings:**

1. **Yes, with sufficient content vocabulary** (Outcome A)
2. **Partially, but function words remain a barrier** (Outcome B)
3. **No, function word bottleneck is insurmountable** (Outcome C)

**All three findings have scientific value.**

## Next Steps

**Immediate (Today):**
1. Create batch validation script
2. Test first 4 priority targets (qol, ory, sal, dai!n)
3. Assess preliminary results

**Tomorrow:**
1. Test remaining 4 targets
2. Compile validation results
3. Calculate total noun validation rate

**Day 3:**
1. Re-translate with any validated nouns
2. Measure coherence improvement
3. Make decision: continue or document

**Phase 5A Status: READY TO BEGIN**

**Clear decision criteria established**
**Timeline defined (5 days)**
**Valuable outcomes regardless of success/failure**
