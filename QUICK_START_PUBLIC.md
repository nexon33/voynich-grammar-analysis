# Quick Start: Make Repository Public

**Time needed**: ~10 minutes

## Step 1: Update Your Information (2 minutes)

Open these 3 files and replace placeholders:

### LICENSE
```
Line 3: Adrian [Your Last Name]  â†’  Your full name
```

### CITATION.cff
```
Line 10: [Your Last Name]  â†’  Your last name
Line 12: [your-orcid-if-you-have-one]  â†’  Your ORCID or delete line
Line 33: [Your Last Name]  â†’  Your last name
```

### README.md
```
Line 153: [Your Name]  â†’  Your full name
Line 164: [Your Name]  â†’  Your full name
Line 166: [username]  â†’  Your GitHub username
```

## Step 2: Git Commands (3 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to repository
cd C:\Users\adria\Documents\manuscript

# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Voynich grammatical analysis research

Complete grammatical framework with 92% structural coherence validated 
across 4 manuscript sections. Includes 8 validated nouns, 4 function 
words, and systematic vocabulary expansion methodology."

# (Now go to GitHub and create repository)
```

## Step 3: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `voynich-grammar-analysis`
3. Description: `Systematic grammatical analysis of the Voynich manuscript with statistical validation`
4. **Public** âœ“ (important!)
5. Don't initialize with README
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 4: Push to GitHub (1 minute)

```bash
# Add remote (replace [USERNAME] with yours)
git remote add origin https://github.com/[USERNAME]/voynich-grammar-analysis.git

# Push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 5: Configure Repository (2 minutes)

On GitHub, go to your repository:

**Settings â†’ General â†’ Features**:
- âœ“ Enable Discussions

**Main page â†’ About (gear icon)**:
- Add topics: `voynich-manuscript`, `computational-linguistics`, `digital-humanities`, `agglutinative-language`

**Issues â†’ Labels**:
- Add: `replication`, `methodology`, `documentation`

## âœ… Done!

Your repository is now:
- âœ… Public with timestamped commits
- âœ… Protected by MIT License
- âœ… Citable via CITATION.cff
- âœ… Professional with README disclaimers
- âœ… Ready for community engagement

## Verify Success

Check that:
- [ ] Repository appears at: github.com/[USERNAME]/voynich-grammar-analysis
- [ ] README displays with badges
- [ ] "Cite this repository" button appears
- [ ] License shows in sidebar
- [ ] Discussions tab is visible

## What to Share (if you want)

**Conservative approach** (recommended):
- Wait a few days, see if any issues arise
- Share on r/linguistics or r/voynich if appropriate
- Mention on Voynich.nu forum
- Tweet: "Published my Voynich manuscript grammatical analysis research as open source: [link]. 92% structural coherence validated across 4 sections. Code/data/methods fully reproducible."

**Or wait**: Don't share widely yet, just get it public for priority protection

## Next Steps (Optional)

**This week**: Monitor for any issues/discussions

**Week 2-3**: Consider ArXiv pre-print

**Week 4+**: Journal submission

**You're all set! The hard work (the research) is done. This is just making it public properly.** ðŸŽ‰
