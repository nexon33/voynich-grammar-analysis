## How to Use With an LLM

### Method 1: Single Line Translation

**Step 1:** Load the entire JSON as context
```
Load COMPLETE_LLM_TRANSLATION_CONTEXT.json into your LLM conversation
```

**Step 2:** Request specific line translation
```
Prompt: "Using the complete Voynich context provided, translate folio line95, 
line 1 into natural English pharmaceutical recipe language."
```

**Step 3:** LLM produces translation with full context
```
LLM has access to:

- Historical parallels (Hildegard recipes)
- Medical context (oak-based decoction)
```

**Expected output:**
- Natural English translation
- Rationale for choices
- Uncertainties noted
- Medical interpretation

---

### Method 2: Full Folio Translation

**Step 1:** Load JSON context

**Step 2:** Request folio translation
```
Prompt: "Using the Voynich context, translate all lines from folio line95 
into a coherent pharmaceutical recipe. Provide:
1. Line-by-line translation
2. Synthesized recipe (combined interpretation)
3. Medical purpose
4. Historical parallels"
```

**Step 3:** LLM produces complete recipe

---

### Method 3: Comparative Translation

**Step 1:** Load JSON context

**Step 2:** Compare multiple translation approaches
```
Prompt: "For folio line95, lines 1-5, provide three translation approaches:
1. Literal morphological translation
2. Natural pharmaceutical English
3. Comparison with Hildegard parallel

Explain which is most accurate and why."
```

---

## Example Prompts

### Prompt 1: Single Line, Natural English
```
Using the complete Voynich manuscript context provided in COMPLETE_LLM_TRANSLATION_CONTEXT.json:

Translate folio line95, line 1 into natural English suitable for a medieval pharmaceutical manual.

Original EVA: otchol chol chy chaiin qotaiindaiin shain
Morphological gloss: oat-vessel botanical-term [PARTICLE] [?ch]-DEF oat-GEN-[?a]-DEF-D-DEF [?sh]-DEF

Context to consider:
- This is an oak-based pharmaceutical recipe
- Uses decoction technique (boiling in vessel)
- Medieval European medical tradition
- Compare to Hildegard of Bingen's style

Provide:
1. Natural English translation
2. Brief rationale for translation choices
3. Any uncertainties
4. Medical interpretation (what is this recipe for?)
```

### Expected LLM Response:
```
TRANSLATION:
"Place oats in vessel with herbs; prepare the oat-derived ingredient, apply [to patient]"

RATIONALE:
- "otchol" = oat-vessel (oat in vessel)
- "chol" = botanical-term (herb/plant)
- "chy" = [PARTICLE] (procedural marker, omitted in natural English)
- "chaiin" = [?ch]-DEF (prepare + definite = "prepare the")
- "qotaiindaiin" = oat-GEN-[?a]-DEF-D-DEF (oat's ingredient, definitized)
- "shain" = [?sh]-DEF (apply + definite = "apply the")

UNCERTAINTIES:
- [?a] uncertain meaning (possibly "extract" or "product")
- Final application method unclear

MEDICAL INTERPRETATION:
This is an oat-based digestive remedy. Oats combined with herbs in vessel suggests 
decoction or infusion. Similar to Hildegard's recipes using oats for digestive complaints.
The oat-derived ingredient likely refers to the decocted liquid or a paste made from 
boiled oats. Medieval medicine used oats for soothing digestive issues.
```

---

### Prompt 2: Recipe Synthesis
```
Using the Voynich context, synthesize folio line131, lines 1-5 into a complete, 
coherent pharmaceutical recipe.

Provide:
1. Complete recipe in modern recipe format (Ingredients, Equipment, Instructions)
2. Medical purpose
3. Closest historical parallel
4. Notes on translation confidence
```

### Expected LLM Response:
```
PHARMACEUTICAL RECIPE: Oat-Oak Decoction

INGREDIENTS:
- Oats
- Oak bark or acorns
- Water
- Additional herbs (unspecified)

EQUIPMENT:
- Vessel (heating pot)
- Container (storage vessel)

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Place oats in vessel
2. Add oak bark or oak-derived substance
3. Add water
4. Place vessel in/over container (possibly water bath or heating apparatus)
5. Prepare/boil the mixture
6. Add herbs
7. Continue processing

MEDICAL PURPOSE:
Digestive remedy, likely for diarrhea or stomach complaints. Oak tannins provide 
astringent properties, oats soothe digestive tract.

HISTORICAL PARALLEL:
Hildegard of Bingen's "Recipe glandulas quercus cum avena" (Take acorns of oak 
with oats) - EXACT MATCH to ingredients.

CONFIDENCE NOTES:
- High confidence: Core ingredients (oak, oat, water, vessel)
- Medium confidence: Exact preparation steps
- Low confidence: Additional herbs (not fully specified)
- Uncertainties: Precise measurements, timing
```

## Advanced Usage

### Improving Specific Translations

If you disagree with a morphological gloss:

```
Prompt: "The morphological gloss translates 'qokchy' as 'oak-GEN-[PARTICLE]'. 
However, considering:
1. It appears with 'qotchol' (oat-GEN-[?ch]-LOC)
2. Context is pharmaceutical recipe
3. Medieval parallel uses 'quercus cum avena' (oak with oats)

Could this be 'oak's [ingredient/product]' rather than just oak-GEN-particle?
Provide linguistic justification."
```

### Finding Patterns

```
Prompt: "Across all lines containing both 'qok' (oak) and 'dain' (water), 
what are the most common action verbs? 

Analyze:
1. Frequency of verb patterns
2. Sequential order (oak before/after water?)
3. Medical interpretation (what technique is described?)
4. Compare to medieval decoction practices"
```

### Historical Validation

```
Prompt: "Compare these 5 Voynich recipes with Hildegard of Bingen's 
pharmaceutical recipes. Identify:
1. Ingredient matches
2. Structural parallels
3. Medical purpose alignment
4. Confidence in attribution to same medical tradition"
```

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Always Provide Full Context
- Load entire JSON file
- Don't just copy-paste one line
- LLM needs morphology, vocabulary, AND historical context

### 2. Be Specific About Translation Goals
- "Literal morphological" vs "natural English"?
- Academic paper vs readable recipe book?
- Maximum accuracy vs maximum readability?

### 3. Request Rationale
- Ask LLM to explain translation choices
- Note uncertainties
- Provide confidence levels

### 4. Compare Multiple Approaches
- Literal translation
- Natural English
- Historical parallel comparison

### 5. Iterate
- First pass: Get translation
- Second pass: Refine based on context
- Third pass: Validate against medical knowledge
