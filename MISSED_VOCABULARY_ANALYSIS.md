## MISSED VOCABULARY OPPORTUNITIES
================================================================================

### HIGH PRIORITY: Persistent Near-Validated Elements (7/10 multiple phases)

**KEOL**
  - Appearances: 2 phases [10, 11]
  - Phase 10: 7/10, n=21, Reason: Near-validated in Phase 10
  - Phase 11: 7/10, n=21, Reason: Persistent near-validated (Phase 10-11)

**OLKEDY**
  - Appearances: 2 phases [10, 11]
  - Phase 10: 7/10, n=26, Reason: Near-validated in Phase 10
  - Phase 11: 7/10, n=26, Reason: Persistent near-validated (Phase 10-11)

**CTHOR**
  - Appearances: 2 phases [10, 11]
  - Phase 10: 7/10, n=42, Reason: Near-validated in Phase 10
  - Phase 11: 7/10, n=42, Reason: Persistent near-validated (Phase 10-11)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY: Single Near-Validated Elements (7/10 once)

**chod** (Phase 11)
  - Score: 7/10
  - Frequency: 10
  - Reason: Persistent near-validated (Phase 10-11)

**shee** (Phase 11)
  - Score: 7/10
  - Frequency: 17
  - Reason: Persistent near-validated (Phase 10-11)

**tcho** (Phase 11)
  - Score: 7/10
  - Frequency: 10
  - Reason: Persistent near-validated (Phase 10-11)

**ot** (Phase 12)
  - Score: 7/10
  - Frequency: 1745
  - Reason: Low validated combination rate (4.1%), later discovered as allomorph in Phase 13

**ct** (Phase 12)
  - Score: 5/10
  - Frequency: 335
  - Reason: Only 67 unique stems, 0% validated combinations

### LOW PRIORITY: Insufficient Data (n<20)
