# Contributing to Voynich Grammatical Analysis

Thank you for your interest in this research! This document outlines how you can contribute.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This is Unpublished Research

This repository contains **unpublished research currently under peer review**. Please keep this in mind when contributing:

- **Methodology questions**: Use GitHub Discussions
- **Bug reports**: Use GitHub Issues
- **Code improvements**: Pull requests welcome
- **Alternative interpretations**: Open as Discussion, not Issue

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Code Improvements

**Welcome contributions:**
- Bug fixes in analysis scripts
- Performance optimizations
- Additional validation tests
- Code documentation improvements
- Unit tests for validation functions

**How to contribute:**
```bash
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (git checkout -b feature/your-feature)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests if applicable
5. Submit a pull request
```

### 2. Validation & Replication

**Highly valued:**
- Independent replication of results
- Cross-validation with different transcriptions
- Statistical methodology review
- Edge case testing

**How to report:**
- Open an Issue with "Replication" label
- Include: your results, methodology, any discrepancies
- We'll discuss and update code/documentation as needed

### 3. Methodology Discussion

**For theoretical/methodological questions:**
- Use GitHub Discussions (not Issues)
- Categories: Q&A, Methodology, General Discussion
- Be constructive and specific

**Topics welcome:**
- Alternative statistical approaches
- Different morphological interpretations
- Comparison with other Voynich research
- Linguistic typology questions

### 4. Bug Reports

**Found a bug?**
- Check if it's already reported in Issues
- Include: steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, environment
- Label: "bug"

**Example:**
```
**Bug**: Phase 6 script crashes on certain input
**Steps to reproduce**: Run `python scripts/phase6/investigate_keo.py`
**Expected**: Script completes successfully
**Actual**: KeyError on line 145
**Environment**: Python 3.10, Windows 11
```

### 5. Documentation

**Help improve documentation:**
- Clarify unclear sections
- Add usage examples
- Translate to other languages (if appropriate)
- Improve code comments

## What NOT to Contribute (Yet)

**Please avoid:**
- Alternative complete translations (this is structural analysis, not full translation)
- Historical authorship theories (out of scope)
- Cryptographic approaches (different methodology)
- Marketing/press materials (premature)

**Reason**: This research focuses on **systematic grammatical analysis**. Other approaches are interesting but belong in separate projects.

## Research Integrity Guidelines

### Transparency
- All changes must be documented
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive
- Any data modifications must be justified

### Reproducibility
- New code should include comments
- Analysis scripts should be self-contained
- Results should be reproducible from code alone

### Citation
- If you build on this work, cite appropriately
- If you identify errors, report them professionally
- Academic disagreements belong in peer review, not social media

## Community Standards

### Be Respectful
- This is a complex, controversial topic (Voynich manuscript)
- Disagree with ideas, not people
- Assume good faith
- Stay focused on methodology and evidence

### Be Constructive
- Criticism should include actionable suggestions
- "This doesn't work" ‚Üí "This could be improved by..."
- Focus on improving the research, not attacking it

### Be Professional
- This is academic research, treat it as such
- Avoid sensationalism ("VOYNICH CRACKED!")
- Acknowledge uncertainties and limitations
- Don't make claims beyond what the evidence supports

## Review Process

**Pull requests:**
1. Automated checks (if configured)
2. Manual code review by maintainers
3. Discussion of changes
4. Merge or request modifications

**Timeline:**
- Bug fixes: Usually within 1 week
- New features: May take 2-4 weeks (need thorough review)
- Major methodology changes: May require extensive discussion

## Questions?

- **Technical questions**: Open an Issue
- **Methodology questions**: Start a Discussion
- **Private inquiries**: Use GitHub private messaging (for sensitive issues only)

## Attribution

Contributors will be acknowledged in:
- Repository CONTRIBUTORS.md file (if we create one)
- Formal publication acknowledgments (for significant contributions)
- Commit history (automatic attribution)

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License (same as the project).
