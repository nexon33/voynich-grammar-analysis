# Deep Dive Research Guide: Understanding Before Analyzing

**Purpose**: Thoroughly understand your data, hypothesis, and methodology before beginning Phase 1 analysis.

**Timeline**: Today - comprehensive review; Tomorrow - begin Phase 1

---

## Part 1: Understanding the Hypothesis (30 minutes)

### Core Questions to Answer

Before analyzing data, ensure you can clearly articulate:

1. **What exactly are we testing?**
   - The Voynich Manuscript (1404-1438) is Middle English women's medical knowledge
   - It uses an invented alphabet (obfuscation, not mathematical encryption)
   - Margery Kempe's Book (1436-1438) serves as a parallel linguistic corpus
   - Both were created to preserve dangerous knowledge before persecution

2. **Why would this work where others failed?**
   - Previous approaches: Continental European, male authorship, cryptanalysis
   - Our approach: English, women's knowledge, cultural recognition, parallel text
   - Paradigm shift: Obfuscation (needs recognition) vs. Encryption (needs key)

3. **What makes this hypothesis testable?**
   - Specific predictions with falsification criteria
   - Statistical methods to test correlations
   - Clear decision points to stop if wrong
   - Replicable methodology

### Reading Assignment

**Essential Reading (in order)**:

1. **README.md** (15 min)
   - Get the big picture
   - Understand the timeline convergence
   - Review the 4-phase testing protocol

2. **action-plan.md** (20 min)
   - Original insight and motivation
   - Why the timeline matters
   - What previous research missed

3. **voynich-kempe-research.md** (45 min)

- Why did both texts appear in 1404-1438?
- What is the "women's secrets" tradition?
- Why couldn't the NSA crack Voynich?
- What makes Margery Kempe relevant?
- How does obfuscation differ from encryption?

### Reflection Questions

After reading, write answers to:

1. If this hypothesis is correct, what should we see in Phase 1?
2. If this hypothesis is wrong, what would falsify it immediately?
3. What assumptions am I making?
4. What could go wrong with this approach?
5. Am I prepared to report negative results?

## Part 2: Exploring the Voynich Data (45 minutes)

### 2.1 Understanding EVA Encoding

The Voynich text you downloaded is in **EVA** (European Voynich Alphabet) - a Latin character representation of Voynich glyphs.

**Open the file**:
```bash
# View first 100 lines
head -n 100 data/voynich/eva_transcription/voynich_eva_takahashi.txt
```

### What You're Looking At

**EVA Characters**:
- `a, e, i, o, y` - Common "vowel-like" symbols
- `d, l, r, s, t, k, f, p, ch, sh` - "Consonant-like" symbols
- Special characters: `8, 9` (gallows characters - rare, significant)

**Structure Observations**:
```
fachys ykal ar ataiin shol shory cth!res y kor sholdy
```

Notice:
- Words separated by spaces (or are they?)
- Certain character combinations very common (`dy`, `ol`, `ch`)
- Some characters rarely start words
- Pattern repetition within "words"

**Questions to Ask**:

1. **Word Boundaries**: Are spaces real word separators, or syllable markers?
2. **Character Frequency**: Which symbols appear most often?
3. **Positional Rules**: Do certain symbols only appear at word start/end?
4. **Repetition**: Why do some "words" repeat so much? (`daiin daiin daiin`)
5. **Structure**: Do "words" have internal structure (prefix-root-suffix)?

### 2.2 Statistical Exploration

**Create a quick analysis** (optional, if you want to code):

```python
# Save as: scripts/exploration/explore_voynich.py

from collections import Counter
from pathlib import Path

# Read Voynich text
voynich_file = Path('data/voynich/eva_transcription/voynich_eva_takahashi.txt')
with open(voynich_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    text = f.read()

# Split into words
words = text.split()

# Basic statistics
print(f"Total words: {len(words):,}")
print(f"Unique words: {len(set(words)):,}")
print(f"Repetition rate: {len(words) / len(set(words)):.2f}x")

# Character frequency
chars = [c for c in text if c.isalpha()]
char_freq = Counter(chars)

print("\nTop 10 most frequent characters:")
for char, count in char_freq.most_common(10):
    freq = count / len(chars) * 100
    print(f"  {char}: {freq:.2f}%")

# Most common words
print("\nTop 20 most common words:")
word_freq = Counter(words)
for word, count in word_freq.most_common(20):
    print(f"  {word}: {count} times")
```

**Run it**:
```bash
python scripts/exploration/explore_voynich.py
```

### 2.3 Visual Inspection

**Look for patterns**:

1. **Beginning of sections** - Might have headers or titles
2. **Repetitive sequences** - Could be formulaic language (recipes, prayers)
3. **Short vs long words** - Function words vs. content words?
4. **Rare characters** - Might mark special terms (plant names?)

**Note observations** in: `journal/voynich_observations.md`

## Part 3: Exploring Margery Kempe's Text (45 minutes)

### 3.1 Understanding Middle English

**Open the file**:
```bash
# View beginning of complete text
head -n 100 data/margery_kempe/middle_english/complete_text.txt
```

### What You're Looking At

**Sample Middle English** (from actual text):
```
Whan this creatur was xx yer of age or sumdele mor, 
sche was maryed to a worschepful burgeys and was wyth 
chylde wythin schort tyme, as kynde wolde.
```

**Modern English equivalent**:
```
When this creature was 20 years of age or somewhat more,
she was married to a worshipful burgess and was with
child within short time, as nature would.
```

### Key Observations

**Spelling Differences**:
- `creatur` = creature
- `sche` = she
- `sumdele` = somewhat
- `chylde` = child
- `tyme` = time

**Vocabulary Notes**:
- "creature" = herself (humility term)
- "worschepful" = respectable
- "burgeys" = merchant/citizen
- "kynde" = nature

**Grammar Observations**:
- Word order similar to modern English
- Some different verb forms
- Spelling highly variable

### 3.2 Thematic Content Analysis

**Search for key themes**:

```bash
# Search for childbirth references
grep -i "child\|birth\|labor\|bear" data/margery_kempe/middle_english/complete_text.txt | head -n 20

# Search for medical terms
grep -i "sek\|syk\|peyne\|payn\|heal" data/margery_kempe/middle_english/complete_text.txt | head -n 20

# Search for religious/mystical
grep -i "lord\|god\|cryst\|praye" data/margery_kempe/middle_english/complete_text.txt | head -n 20

# Search for emotional states
grep -i "wep\|cry\|tear\|sor\|joy" data/margery_kempe/middle_english/complete_text.txt | head -n 20
```

### 3.3 Vocabulary Inventory

**Create categories** (note in `journal/kempe_vocabulary.md`):

**Medical/Physical**:
- seke (sick), peyne (pain), hele (heal)
- wombe (womb), chylde (child), modyr (mother)
- blod (blood), flesch (flesh), body

**Botanical** (if any):
- Look for plant names, herbs, roots, leaves
- Medical preparation terms

**Anatomical**:
- Body part terms
- Reproductive terminology (may be euphemistic)

**Emotional/Psychological**:
- wepyng (weeping), sorwe (sorrow), joye (joy)
- These may relate to postpartum mental health

**Religious**:
- lord, god, cryst (Christ), preyere (prayer)
- Could provide cover for medical terminology

### 3.4 Understanding the Author

**Key facts about Margery**:
- Born c. 1373 in King's Lynn, Norfolk
- Married at ~20, had 14 children
- Severe postpartum psychosis after first birth
- Illiterate - dictated her book
- Mystic - claimed visions of Christ
- Traveled extensively (Jerusalem, Rome, Spain, Germany)
- Accused of heresy multiple times
- Book written 1436-1438 by scribes

**Questions to consider**:
1. What medical knowledge would a woman with 14 children have?
2. How would she have learned about women's health?
3. Why did she dictate this book at this specific time?
4. What couldn't she say directly in her book?
5. Could she have been part of a knowledge network?

**Document thoughts** in: `journal/margery_context.md`

## Part 4: Understanding Middle English Corpus (30 minutes)

### 4.1 What's in CMEPV

**List available texts**:
```bash
ls data/middle_english_corpus/cmepv/middle_english_text_cmepv/sgml/
```

You should see ~127 SGML files with names like:
- `Chaucer.sgm` - Canterbury Tales
- `Wyclif.sgm` - Wycliffite Bible  
- `Ancrene.sgm` - Ancrene Riwle (religious text for women)
- `Juliana.sgm` - Life of St. Juliana
- Many more...

### 4.2 Sample a Few Texts

**Look at structure**:
```bash
head -n 50 data/middle_english_corpus/cmepv/middle_english_text_cmepv/sgml/Chaucer.sgm
```

**SGML format**:
```xml
<TEXT>
<AUTHOR>Geoffrey Chaucer</AUTHOR>
<TITLE>Canterbury Tales</TITLE>
<DATE>c. 1400</DATE>
...
<BODY>
Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote...
</BODY>
</TEXT>
```

### 4.3 Identifying 1400-1450 Texts

**Date filtering strategy**:

We need texts from **1400-1450** specifically to match Voynich dating.

**Relevant texts to prioritize**:
- Religious prose (sermons, saints' lives)
- Medical texts (if any)
- Norfolk/East Midlands dialect texts
- Women's religious writings
- Devotional literature

**Create inventory** in: `journal/corpus_inventory.md`

List texts with:
- Filename
- Approximate date
- Dialect (if known)
- Subject matter
- Priority for analysis (High/Medium/Low)

## Part 5: Understanding the Methodology (60 minutes)

### 5.1 Read the Complete Methodology

**Open and read carefully**:
```bash
# If on Windows
notepad docs/methodology.md

# Or open in your preferred editor
```

**Reading strategy** (don't just skim):

1. **Section-by-section notes**: As you read each phase, write:
   - What is being tested?
   - How is it being tested?
   - What constitutes success?
   - What constitutes failure?
   - What are the statistical tests?
   - What happens at the decision point?

2. **Questions to answer**:
   - Do I understand why each phase is necessary?
   - Are the falsification criteria clear?
   - Do the statistical methods make sense?
   - Can I implement these tests?
   - What skills/knowledge do I need to develop?

### 5.2 Deep Dive: Phase 1 Frequency Analysis

**This is where you'll start tomorrow**, so understand it thoroughly.

**The Core Idea**:
If Voynich encodes Middle English with invented alphabet, then:
- Each Voynich symbol = one phoneme (sound)
- Symbol frequencies should match phoneme frequencies
- English has specific frequency patterns (e, t, a, o, i are common)

**What you need to do**:

**Step 1**: Count Voynich symbols
```
Input: voynich_eva_takahashi.txt
Process: Count each EVA character
Output: Distribution (e.g., 'o' = 15%, 'a' = 12%, etc.)
```

**Step 2**: Calculate ME phoneme frequencies
```
Input: ME corpus texts (1400-1450)
Process: Convert spelling → sounds → count
Output: Distribution (e.g., /ə/ = 18%, /e/ = 10%, etc.)
```

**Challenge**: ME spelling → pronunciation not 1:1
- "knight" = /kniçt/ (pronounce the k and gh)
- "maketh" = /maːkəθ/ (final -e sometimes silent)
- "goode" = /goːdə/ (long vowel, schwa at end)

**Solution**: Use ME phonological rules (Lass, Mosse, Jordan)

**Step 3**: Statistical comparison
```
Question: Are the two distributions similar?
Tests:
- Chi-square goodness of fit test
- Pearson correlation
- Spearman rank correlation
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

Decision: If p < 0.05 and r > 0.6, continue to Phase 2
```

**Potential Issues**:
1. Voynich might encode vowels differently (not 1:1)
2. Multiple phonemes could map to one symbol
3. One phoneme could map to multiple symbols (allophones)
4. Dialect differences in pronunciation
5. Scribe variations in spelling

**How to handle**:
- Test multiple hypotheses
- Try different phoneme inventories
- Account for Norfolk dialect features
- Document all assumptions

### 5.3 Understanding Statistical Tests

**If statistics isn't your strength**, review:

**Chi-Square Test**:
- Compares observed vs. expected distributions
- Null hypothesis: distributions are the same
- p < 0.05 means significant difference (reject null)
- For our use: p > 0.05 would support hypothesis (distributions similar)

**Correlation Coefficient**:
- Measures linear relationship (-1 to +1)
- r = 0: no relationship
- r = 1: perfect positive correlation
- r > 0.6: strong correlation (our threshold)

**Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**:
- Compares cumulative distribution functions
- Non-parametric (doesn't assume normal distribution)
- Good for validating other tests

**Resources**:
- Python `scipy.stats` documentation
- Khan Academy statistics course
- "Statistics Done Wrong" by Alex Reinhart (free online)

### 5.4 Planning Your Analysis

## Part 6: Critical Evaluation (30 minutes)

### 6.1 Playing Devil's Advocate

**Before you invest weeks in this**, critically evaluate:

**Reasons the hypothesis might be WRONG**:

1. **Language might not be English**
   - Statistical properties could match other languages
   - Continental European origin still more likely?

2. **Might not be language at all**
   - Could be elaborate hoax
   - Could be glossolalia (nonsense with structure)
   - Could be musical notation, shorthand, etc.

3. **Frequency matching might be coincidence**
   - Many languages have similar frequency patterns
   - Random data can show spurious correlations

4. **Margery Kempe connection might be superficial**
   - Temporal coincidence doesn't prove relationship
   - Content overlap doesn't prove linguistic connection

5. **Obfuscation theory might be wrong**
   - Maybe it IS mathematical encryption (NSA just wrong method)
   - Maybe it's a constructed language (like Esperanto)

**How to mitigate**:
- Test against other languages (Latin, Italian, French)
- Use rigorous statistical significance thresholds
- Have clear falsification criteria
- Be willing to abandon hypothesis if evidence contradicts

**Document concerns** in: `journal/critical_evaluation.md`

### 6.2 Understanding Confirmation Bias

**Psychological traps to avoid**:

1. **Pattern matching on noise**
   - Human brains see patterns everywhere
   - Mitigation: Require statistical significance

2. **Cherry-picking data**
   - Only reporting results that support hypothesis
   - Mitigation: Report all tests, even failures

3. **Moving goalposts**
   - Changing criteria when results don't match
   - Mitigation: Pre-register decision criteria

4. **Sunk cost fallacy**
   - Continuing despite negative evidence
   - Mitigation: Clear stopping points

**Commitment**: Write in your journal:
```
I commit to:
1. Reporting negative results honestly
2. Following the decision criteria even if disappointing
3. Not modifying methodology to get desired results
4. Stopping if Phase 1 clearly fails
5. Treating falsification as success in science
```

### 6.3 What Success Actually Looks Like

**If hypothesis is TRUE**, you'll see:
- Phase 1: Strong correlation (r > 0.6, p < 0.05)
- Phase 2: Non-random vocabulary clustering
- Phase 3: Coherent ME words emerge from decoding
- Phase 4: Medical content makes historical sense

**If hypothesis is FALSE**, you'll see:
- Phase 1: No correlation or weak correlation
- Random patterns throughout
- Gibberish when decoded
- No semantic coherence

**If results are AMBIGUOUS**, you'll see:
- Some correlation but not strong
- Partial success in some sections
- Might indicate: mixed language, multiple hands, partial encoding

**Most importantly**: All three outcomes are valuable for science.
