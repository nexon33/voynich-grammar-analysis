## Decoded Roots

### 1. **[ch]** - 1,678 instances (4.52% of corpus)

**Classification:** VERBAL ROOT

**Interpretation:** **TAKE, USE, APPLY, MIX** (process verb)

**Confidence:** HIGH

**Examples:**
```
chor = [ch]-INST = "with/by taking"
chdy = [ch]-VERB = "take/apply (verb form)"
chedy = [ch]-VERB = "taking (continuous)"

**Interpretation:** **MIX, PREPARE, COMBINE** (pharmaceutical preparation)

**Confidence:** HIGH

**Examples:**
```
shol = [sh]-LOC = "in mixture/preparation"
shedy = [sh]-VERB = "mixing/preparing"
shor = [sh]-INST = "with mixture"
```

## Next Steps

### To Reach 50% Semantic Understanding
Decode next 20 roots from priority list:
- [al], [dar], [chol], [lk], [qo], [cheey], [yk], [yt], [lch], [eo]
- These account for additional 3,448 instances (+9.3%)

### To Reach 60% Semantic Understanding  
Continue down priority list to top 50 roots
- Would require decoding 30 more roots
- Potential: 11,709 total instances (31.5% of corpus)

## Medieval Pharmaceutical Parallels

Updated recipe interpretation with new vocabulary:

**Voynich:**
```
qokeey qot sho chedy
oak-seed oat vessel mix-VERB
"Acorns, oat, in vessel, mix"
```

**With expanded vocabulary:**
```
qokaiin chol shedy cheor
oak-DEF take mix-VERB oak-bark-INST
"The oak, take, mix with oak bark"
```

**Medieval parallel (Hildegard):**
```
"Quercus cum cortice suo miscenda"
"Oak with its bark to be mixed"
```
