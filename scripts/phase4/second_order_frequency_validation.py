"""
Second-Order Frequency Validation
==================================

We've validated that oak/oat are real words (enriched 3x in baths, p<0.001).
Now use them as anchors to validate OTHER words through association patterns.

Second-order validation concept:
- If word X consistently appears with validated words (oak/oat/verbs/pronouns)
- And X shows similar distribution patterns
- Then X is likely REAL and not cipher noise

This is like using a known molecule to find related compounds through
chromatography - we look for co-occurrence and distribution similarity.

Validation methods:
1. Co-occurrence frequency: Does X appear near validated words more than random?
2. Distribution correlation: Does X appear in same sections as validated words?
3. Morphological consistency: Does X follow same affix patterns?
4. Functional consistency: Does X behave like other words of same class?
