"""
Test the hypothesis of SELECTIVE/PARTIAL obfuscation.

User's insight: Not all letters are converted - some 'e's stay as 'e',
some become 'o'. This is like spoken language games (P language, Pig Latin)
where obfuscation is selective, not algorithmic.

This would explain:
1. Why "sheep" stays "sheep" (already has 'e', no conversion)
2. Why some -er suffixes don't become -or
3. The 90.9% consistency (systematic when applied, but not always applied)
