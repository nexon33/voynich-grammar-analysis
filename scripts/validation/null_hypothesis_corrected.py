CORRECTED NULL HYPOTHESIS TEST: High-Frequency vs Low-Frequency Words

The previous test was WRONG - it tested high-frequency words against high-frequency words.
High-frequency words SHOULD score high (they're grammatical elements in any language).

CORRECTED RESEARCH QUESTION:
  Does our validation system distinguish grammatical function words from content words?

METHOD:
  Compare two groups:
  1. HIGH-FREQUENCY words (>100 occurrences) - expected to be function words/morphemes
  2. LOW-FREQUENCY words (10-50 occurrences) - expected to be content words

EXPECTED RESULT (if system works):
  - High-frequency: Average 7-10/10 (grammatical elements)
  - Low-frequency: Average 2-4/10 (content words)
  - Our validated terms (ar=9/10, daiin=8/10) should cluster with high-frequency group

This validates that our system identifies GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE, not random noise.
