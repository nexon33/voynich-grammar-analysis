# Norfolk Dialect Resources (1400-1450)

## Primary Resource: eLALME

**Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English (electronic)**

- **URL**: http://www.amc.lel.ed.ac.uk/amc-projects-hub/project/elalme/
- **Date Range**: 1325-1450 (PERFECT for our needs)
- **Access**: Free online, some features require registration
- **Focus**: Geographic distribution of dialect features

### How to Use eLALME for Our Research

1. **Access the Atlas**
   - Visit URL above
   - Register if required (free)
   - Explore interactive map

2. **Focus on Norfolk/East Anglia**
   - Locate Norfolk region on map
   - East Midlands dialect area
   - King's Lynn area (where Margery Kempe lived)

3. **Extract Key Features**
   - Phonological markers
   - Lexical variations
   - Morphological patterns
   - Compare to Standard Middle English

4. **Document Findings**
   - Create feature list for Norfolk dialect 1400-1450
   - Note pronunciation differences
   - Identify characteristic vocabulary
   - Map to possible Voynich patterns

## Norfolk Dialect Characteristics

### Known Features (from modern/historical sources)

1. **H-Retention**
   - Unlike most English dialects, Norfolk does NOT drop /h/
   - Initial /h/ consistently pronounced
   - IMPORTANT for phonological analysis

2. **Consonant Cluster Changes**
   - ⟨thr⟩ → /tr/ (three = tree)
   - ⟨shr⟩ → /sr/ (shriek = /sriːk/)
   - May apply to Middle English period

3. **Geographic Context**
   - East Midlands dialect area
   - Distinct from Northern and Southern ME
   - Influenced by Norwich (major urban center)

4. **Margery Kempe's Language**
   - Native Norfolk speaker
   - Dictated in local dialect
   - TEAMS text preserves dialectal features
   - Compare with Standard ME

## Research Tasks

### Task 1: Create Norfolk Feature List
- [ ] Access eLALME
- [ ] Navigate to Norfolk region
- [ ] List phonological features
- [ ] List lexical features
- [ ] Document in `norfolk_features.txt`

### Task 2: Extract from Margery Kempe
- [ ] Identify Norfolk-specific vocabulary in Kempe text
- [ ] Note pronunciation markers
- [ ] Compare with Standard ME equivalents
- [ ] Document in `kempe_dialect_markers.txt`

### Task 3: Create Phoneme Inventory
- [ ] List Norfolk ME consonants
- [ ] List Norfolk ME vowels
- [ ] Note diphthongs
- [ ] Create frequency distribution
- [ ] Compare with Voynich symbol frequencies

## Additional Resources

### Academic Sources

## Integration with Main Research

### How Norfolk Features Connect to Hypothesis

1. **If Voynich is Middle English**:
   - Should show ME phoneme distribution
   - Might show dialect-specific features
   - Norfolk features would suggest English origin

2. **Margery Kempe as Key**:
   - Her Norfolk dialect provides baseline
   - Vocabulary overlap would validate
   - Phonological patterns could decode alphabet

3. **Testing Protocol**:
   - Extract Norfolk phoneme frequencies
   - Compare with Voynich symbol frequencies
   - Look for statistical correlation
   - Test decoding hypotheses

## Data Collection Format

Create structured files:
- `norfolk_phonemes.json` - Phoneme inventory with frequencies
- `norfolk_vocabulary.txt` - Characteristic Norfolk words
- `kempe_dialect_features.txt` - Features in Margery's text
- `comparison_notes.md` - Analysis notes
