## Key Findings (from public sources)

### Johannes Hartlieb (c. 1410-1468)
- Bavarian physician
- Lived around same time/place as Voynich creation
- Wrote about plants, women, magic, astronomy, baths
- **Advocated "secret letters" for gynecological recipes**

### Encryption Culture
- Widespread self-censorship of women's health knowledge
- Authors deliberately obscured dangerous information
- **Cipher specifically for contraception/abortion recipes**
- Not paranoia—systematic cultural pattern

### Specific Examples Decoded
- **21-line cipher from northern Italy**
- Recipe with gynecological uses
- **Including abortion**
- Proves cipher use for exactly this content

### Self-Censorship Patterns
- Erased genital terms in manuscripts
- Removed pages from gynecological texts
- Authors omitting "dangerous" knowledge
- Readers destroying information

### Relevance to Voynich
- Voynich fits exactly this pattern
- Same period (1404-1438)
- Same content domains
- Same geographic area
- **Encoding women's secrets was NORMAL practice**

## Why This Study Matters for Our Research

### Validates Core Hypothesis
1. **Cultural Context**: Encoding medical knowledge was expected
2. **Method**: "Secret letters" = invented alphabets used
3. **Content**: Gynecology, contraception, abortion targeted
4. **Motivation**: Fear of persecution justified

### Strengthens Obfuscation Theory
- Not just theoretical—proven practice
- Multiple examples decoded
- Hartlieb explicitly recommended it
- **Our hypothesis fits historical pattern**

### Provides Methodology Clues
- Study shows how to decode period ciphers
- Techniques might apply to Voynich
- Understanding cultural context is key
- Recognition over brute force

## Integration with Our Research

### Questions to Answer
1. Did Hartlieb's advice influence Voynich creation?
2. Are Voynich "secret letters" similar to decoded examples?
3. Does Voynich follow same content pattern?
4. Can we apply Brewer & Lewis methods to Voynich?

### Research Tasks
- [ ] Obtain full paper (via library)
- [ ] Study decoding methods used
- [ ] Extract technical details of ciphers
- [ ] Compare with Voynich structure
- [ ] Apply insights to hypothesis testing
