# Null Hypothesis Test Results - READ THIS FIRST

**Date:** 2025-01-31  
**Status:** üö® **CRITICAL FINDINGS**

---

## TL;DR

The null hypothesis test revealed the methodology has serious issues:

1. **Recognition is ~18%, not 98%** - We've been counting suffix matches as "recognition" even when we don't know root meanings
2. **Word order doesn't matter** - Scrambled text gives identical results (58.2% = 58.2%)
3. **Pattern matching ‚â† understanding** - We identify grammar but not meaning

**Recommendation:** DO NOT publish claims of 98% decipherment without addressing these issues.

## The Key Finding

We ran the recognition system on scrambled text:

```
Real Voynich:           58.2% recognition
Scrambled word order:   58.2% recognition  ‚Üê IDENTICAL!
```

This proves recognition is based on **word structure alone**, not grammar or syntax.

## The Recognition Inflation Problem

What "73.8% recognition" actually means:

- **24.6%** - Fully known words (HIGH confidence)
- **49.2%** - Unknown roots with known suffixes (MEDIUM confidence) ‚Üê THE PROBLEM
- **26.2%** - Completely unknown

**49.2% of "recognized" words are things like:**
- `ykal` ‚Üí `[?yk]-LOC` = "unknown thing in a location"
- `sholdy` ‚Üí `[?sh]-VERB-LOC` = "verbing unknown in a location"

We recognize the suffix (-LOC, -VERB) but NOT what the word means!

**True semantic understanding: ~18%**

## What This Means

### ‚ùå NOT Supported By Evidence
- 98% decipherment claim
- Continuous aspect marking (medial 'e')
- Validated case system relationships
- Discourse structure
- Grammatical word order

### ‚úì Actually Valid
- Suffix system exists (~10-15 suffixes identified)
- Agglutinative structure (words decompose consistently)
- Morphological patterns (~58% coverage)
- Vocabulary candidates (~10-20 words proposed)

### Corrected Recognition Rates
- **Morphological pattern matching:** 58%
- **Suffix identification:** 49%
- **Semantic understanding:** 18%
- **High confidence words:** 25%

## What You Should Do

### If You Haven't Posted Yet
**Good!** Revise claims to reflect ~18-25% actual understanding, focus on morphological findings rather than "decipherment complete."

### If You Already Posted
1. Add null hypothesis test results (shows scientific rigor)
2. Correct recognition rate to ~18-25%
3. Acknowledge the limitations
4. Frame as "morphological progress" not "complete decipherment"

**Quick summary:** `NULL_HYPOTHESIS_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` (this is most important)

**Detailed findings:** `NULL_HYPOTHESIS_FINDINGS.md`

**Full analysis:** `CRITICAL_METHODOLOGY_ISSUES.md`

**Raw data:**
- `TRUE_RECOGNITION_ANALYSIS.json` - Shows 18% vs 73% breakdown
- `FIXED_NULL_HYPOTHESIS_RESULTS.json` - Shows scrambled text results
- `NULL_HYPOTHESIS_COMPREHENSIVE_RESULTS.json` - Full test results

## The Bottom Line

**You asked for null hypothesis testing. Both Claude and Gemini said it was critical. We ran it.**

**The test revealed major methodology issues:**
- Recognition rate inflated by ~55%
- Pattern matching mistaken for understanding
- No evidence word order/grammar matters

**The good news:** We found this BEFORE publication, not after.

**The path forward:** Honest re-assessment, corrected claims, and focus on what's actually been achieved (morphological patterns, not complete decipherment).

## Next Steps

1. **Read:** `NULL_HYPOTHESIS_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
2. **Decide:** Fix and continue, or pull and revise?
3. **Act:** Update any public claims to reflect actual ~18-25% recognition
4. **Validate:** Get independent confirmation of vocabulary candidates

**This is what you asked for. The null hypothesis test did its job.**

Now you need to decide how to respond to these findings.
