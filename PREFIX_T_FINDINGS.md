# Prefix Analysis: T- Prefix Investigation

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Script:** `scripts/analysis/investigate_prefix_semantics.py`  
**Key Finding:** T- is a highly productive prefix (973 instances), while qok-/qot- are NOT prefixes

---

## Executive Summary

Investigation of four potential prefixes (qok-, qot-, ot-, t-) reveals:

**qok- and qot-**: NOT prefixes - these are parts of "oak" and "oat" (already identified morphemes)
- qok- appears in "qokaiin" (oak-GEN-AIN), "qokeey" (oak-GEN-[?eey]), etc.
- qot- appears in "qotaldy" (oat-GEN-[?al]-D), "qoteedy" (oat-GEN-[?eedy]), etc.

**ot-**: Very rare (5 instances), possibly related to t-

**T-**: HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE PREFIX (973 instances, 18.7% of all sentences!)
- Attaches to multiple morpheme types
- Shows interesting grammatical distribution
- May have instrumental/locative semantic function

## T- Prefix Detailed Analysis

### Frequency and Distribution

**Total instances:** 973 (appears in ~18.7% of 5,204 sentences)

**Grammatical rates:**
- VERB rate: 19.4% (189 instances)
- NOUN indicators: 15.1% (147 instances with case markers)
- Other: 65.5% (637 instances - particles, prepositions, etc.)

**Classification:** NEUTRAL (neither strongly VERBAL nor NOMINAL)
- T- can attach to verbs, nouns, particles, and prepositions
- This suggests it may be a grammatical marker rather than a derivational prefix

### Top Stems with T-

| Stem | Count | Type | Percentage |
|------|-------|------|------------|
| T-[?ch] | 98 | Unknown root | 10.1% |
| T-[?e] | 93 | Unknown root | 9.6% |
| T-[PARTICLE] | 57 | Particle | 5.9% |
| T-OL | 54 | Known morpheme | 5.5% |
| T-AT/IN | 52 | Preposition | 5.3% |
| T-vessel | 43 | Noun (container) | 4.4% |
| T-[?a] | 42 | Unknown root | 4.3% |
| T-[?o] | 41 | Unknown root | 4.2% |
| T-[?sh] | 29 | VERB root | 3.0% |
| T-OR | 26 | Conjunction | 2.7% |

**Key observation:** T- attaches to:
- Unknown roots ([?ch], [?e], [?a], [?o], [?sh]): 303 instances (31.1%)
- Known grammatical morphemes (PARTICLE, OL, AT/IN, OR): 189 instances (19.4%)
- Nouns (vessel): 43 instances (4.4%)

### Suffix Distribution

T- prefixed words commonly take these suffixes:

| Suffix | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| -VERB | 191 | 19.6% |
| -DEF | 114 | 11.7% |
| -D | 107 | 11.0% |
| -LOC | 95 | 9.8% |
| -INST | 54 | 5.5% |
| -DIR | 43 | 4.4% |

**Key observation:** 
- Locative/instrumental suffixes are common: LOC (9.8%), INST (5.5%), DIR (4.4%)
- Total locative/instrumental/directional: 19.7%
- This suggests T- may have spatial or instrumental semantics

### Co-occurrence Patterns

**Top 10 words BEFORE T-:**
1. [PARTICLE] (76×)
2. [?ch]-VERB (41×) - process context
3. botanical-term (37×)
4. THIS/THAT (33×)
5. OL (19×)
6. AT-[?e]-VERB (18×)
7. [?sheey] (16×)
8. oak-GEN-[?e]-VERB (16×) - process context
9. [?dy] (15×)
10. [?shey] (15×)

**Top 10 words AFTER T-:**
1. THIS/THAT (48×)
2. [PARTICLE] (45×)
3. [?sh]-VERB (40×) - action sequence
4. oak-GEN-[?e]-VERB (36×) - process context
5. [?ch]-VERB (36×) - action sequence
6. botanical-term (30×)
7. OL (29×)
8. AT/IN (27×)
9. oak-DEF (24×)
10. OR (23×)

**Pattern analysis:**
- T- appears in VERB sequences: `[?ch]-VERB ... T-X ... [?sh]-VERB`
- Co-occurs with botanical-term (37× before, 30× after)
- Co-occurs with oak-GEN process contexts
- Appears with deictic THIS/THAT (33× before, 48× after)

## Semantic Hypothesis (LOW confidence)

### Hypothesis 1: Instrumental/Locative Marker

**Evidence:**
- 19.7% of T- words have locative/instrumental/directional suffixes
- Top co-occurrences include AT/IN (52×), vessel (43×), and locative contexts
- T-vessel (43×) suggests "in vessel" or "with vessel"
- Sample: `T-[?a]-INST` = "with/using [?a]"

**Possible meaning:** "in", "with", "by means of", "at"

**Compare with AT/IN preposition:**
- AT/IN: 52 instances with T- prefix
- This suggests T- might be a related or variant form
- Possible: T- = "at/in/with" (instrumental-locative marker)

### Hypothesis 2: Definite/Deictic Marker

**Evidence:**
- Co-occurs with THIS/THAT (33× before, 48× after)
- Often appears with -DEF suffix (114×, 11.7%)
- Sample: `THIS/THAT T-[?eo]-VERB` = "this [action]"

**Possible meaning:** "the", "this", "that" (definiteness marker)

### Hypothesis 3: Temporal Marker ("then", "at that time")

**Evidence:**
- Appears in VERB sequences: `[?ch]-VERB ... T-X ... [?sh]-VERB`
- May mark temporal progression in recipe steps
- 19.4% VERB rate suggests procedural context

**Possible meaning:** "then", "next", "at that point"

## Comparative Analysis: T- vs AT/IN

| Feature | T- | AT/IN |
|---------|----|----|
| Total instances | 973 | ~400 (est.) |
| Can prefix other morphemes | YES | NO |
| Appears with -LOC | 95× (9.8%) | N/A |
| Appears with -INST | 54× (5.5%) | N/A |
| Co-occurs with vessel | 43× | Common |

**Key difference:** T- is a PREFIX that can attach to stems, while AT/IN is a standalone PREPOSITION.

**Possible relationship:**
- T- may be a grammaticalized/bound form of AT/IN
- Similar to how English "to" (preposition) becomes "-to" in some compounds
- Example: "into" (in + to) → grammaticalized form

---

## Cross-Linguistic Parallels

### Similar Prefixes in Natural Languages

**Hungarian t- (demonstrative prefix):**
- t-ő "this one (human)"
- t-az "that"
- Marks deixis (demonstrative function)

**Turkish -da/-de (locative suffix):**
- ev-de "in the house"
- Similar to potential T- locative function

**Latin in- (preposition/prefix):**
- in silva "in the forest" (preposition)
- in-venio "I find (into-come)" (prefix)
- Similar dual usage (standalone vs. bound)

**Parallels suggest:** T- may be a bound locative/instrumental marker grammaticalized from a preposition.

---

## T- Productivity Analysis

### Stem Diversity

T- attaches to **at least 50+ different stems**, including:
- Unknown roots: [?ch], [?e], [?a], [?o], [?sh], [?otchy]
- Known morphemes: OL, AT/IN, OR, vessel, botanical-term
- Particles: [PARTICLE]

**High productivity** suggests T- is a grammatical affix, not a lexical prefix.

### Distribution Across Manuscript

To verify: Does T- appear consistently across all sections?
- If YES → grammatical morpheme (like -LOC, -INST)
- If NO → may have semantic restrictions

**Prediction:** T- should appear in all sections at ~18-20% rate if it's purely grammatical.

---

## Validation Requirements

To elevate confidence from LOW to MODERATE:

1. **Cross-section consistency check**
   - Verify T- appears in all manuscript sections (Herbal, Biological, Stars, etc.)
   - Check if frequency rate (~18.7%) is consistent

2. **Substitution test**
   - Find minimal pairs: same stem with/without T-
   - Example: [?ch] vs T-[?ch] - what's the difference?
   - Check if meaning changes consistently

3. **Suffix interaction test**
   - Check if T- + LOC is more common than T- alone
   - Test hypothesis: T- marks spatial/instrumental relations

4. **Co-occurrence exclusion test**
   - Does T- exclude certain morphemes?
   - Example: Can T- appear with -GEN? (possessive vs. locative?)

---

## Implications for Translation

### Recipe Pattern (Revised)

**Previous pattern:**
```
[?al] + [?ch]-VERB + [?sh]-VERB
(substance + prepare + apply)
```

**Extended pattern with T-:**
```
[?al] + T-vessel + [?ch]-VERB + [?sh]-VERB
(substance + in-vessel + prepare + apply)
```

**Example translation (TENTATIVE):**

`line493`: `T-[?otchy] [?ke]-INST [PARTICLE] [?ky]`
- Structural: "in/with-[?otchy] [?ke]-INST [PARTICLE] [?ky]"
- Tentative: "In vessel, with [?ke], [action]"

`line5075`: `[?ch]-VERB oak-GEN-[?a]-DEF oak-GEN-[?ch]-VERB oat-GEN-[?oteeey] [?r]-DEF vessel`
- Structural: "prepare oak's-[?a]-DEF oak's-prepare oat's-[?oteeey] [?r]-DEF vessel"
- Tentative: "Prepare the oak's [?a], prepare oak's [substance], oat's [?oteeey], the [?r] in vessel"

---

## OT- Analysis (5 instances)

**Total:** Only 5 instances - TOO RARE for reliable classification

**Observation:** All 5 instances contain forms similar to T-:
1. `T-[?otchy]` - vessel term
2. `AT-[?otchy]` - vessel with preposition
3. `AT-[?ota]`
4. `AT-[?otch]-VERB`
5. `oat-GEN-[?oteeey]` - possibly NOT an ot- prefix, but "oat" morpheme

**Conclusion:** "ot-" is NOT a distinct prefix. These are either:
- T-prefix forms that happen to have "o" in the stem: T-[?otchy]
- AT/IN preposition forms: AT-[?ota]
- "oat" morpheme forms: oat-GEN

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Cross-section distribution check for T-**
   - Script: Check T- frequency in Herbal vs Biological vs Stars sections
   - Prediction: Should be ~18-20% in all sections if grammatical

2. **Minimal pair analysis**
   - Find sentences with same stem ±T-
   - Example: Find [?ch] without T-, compare with T-[?ch]
   - Check semantic difference

3. **T-vessel specific analysis**
   - 43 instances of T-vessel
   - Check what follows T-vessel (process verbs?)
   - Test: Does T-vessel mark container for recipe?

### Future Work

4. **Investigate T- + case marker combinations**
   - T-X-LOC (95×): "in/at X"
   - T-X-INST (54×): "with/by means of X"
   - T-X-DIR (43×): "to/toward X"

5. **Compare T- with other locative markers**
   - AT/IN preposition
   - -LOC suffix
   - T- prefix
   - Are these in complementary distribution?

## Confidence Summary

| Prefix | Instances | Status | Confidence |
|--------|-----------|--------|------------|
| qok- | 0 | NOT A PREFIX (part of "oak") | N/A |
| qot- | 0 | NOT A PREFIX (part of "oat") | N/A |
| ot- | 5 | NOT DISTINCT (variant of T-?) | N/A |
| **T-** | **973** | **PRODUCTIVE PREFIX** | **LOW → MODERATE** |

**T- Classification:** Grammatical prefix, likely instrumental/locative marker

**Semantic interpretation:** "in", "with", "at", "by means of" (TENTATIVE, LOW confidence)

**Next validation:** Cross-section consistency check, minimal pair analysis

## Technical Notes

**Script:** `scripts/analysis/investigate_prefix_semantics.py`  
**Output:** `PREFIX_ANALYSIS.json`  
**Runtime:** ~5 seconds for 5,204 sentences

**Regex patterns used:**
- qok-: `\bqok` (matched "oak" morpheme, not a prefix)
- qot-: `\bqot` (matched "oat" morpheme, not a prefix)
- ot-: `\bot(?!-PREP)` (5 instances, not distinct)
- t-: `\bt-` (973 instances - PRODUCTIVE PREFIX)

**Key finding:** Case-insensitive search revealed that "qok" and "qot" in translations refer to "oak" (qokaiin = oak-GEN-AIN) and "oat" (qotaldy = oat-GEN-[?al]-D), NOT separate prefixes.
