# Scribe-Grammar Independence Test Results

## Test Purpose

This test validates whether the identified agglutinative grammar patterns
remain consistent across different scribal hands (Currier A vs B). If the
grammar is truly linguistic rather than artifacts of scribal habits, we
expect similar patterns in both language groups.

## Methodology

We compared four grammatical metrics across Currier A (101 folios, ~10536 words)
and Currier B (68 folios, ~22857 words):

1. **Suffix Attachment Rate**: % of words with validated suffixes
2. **Morphological Productivity**: % of root appearances in compounds
3. **Function Word Position**: Position distribution (initial/medial/final)
4. **Genitive Prefix Usage**: % of words with qok-/qot- prefix

## Results

Test passed: YES

See console output for detailed statistics.

## Implications

The grammar shows strong consistency across both Currier languages,
providing independent validation that the identified patterns represent
genuine linguistic structure rather than scribal artifacts.
