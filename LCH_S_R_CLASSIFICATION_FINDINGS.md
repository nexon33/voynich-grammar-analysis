**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Methodology:** Phase 18-19 grammatical classification (VERB vs NOUN distinction)  
**Script:** `scripts/analysis/investigate_lch_s_r_roots.py`

## Executive Summary

Applied distributional analysis to three high-frequency unknown roots using the same methodology that successfully classified [?sh]/[?ch] as VERBAL and [?al] as NOMINAL in Phase 18-19.

**Key Findings:**
- **[?lch]**: VERBAL (MODERATE confidence) - 582 instances, 40.4% VERB suffix rate, 12.5% standalone
- **[?s]**: LIKELY NOMINAL (LOW confidence) - 694 instances, 0.7% VERB suffix rate, 22.6% standalone
- **[?r]**: LIKELY NOMINAL (LOW confidence) - 289 instances, 0.3% VERB suffix rate, 21.5% standalone

## Methodology

### Classification Criteria

Based on Phase 18-19 validated patterns:

**VERBAL roots** ([?sh], [?ch]):
- High VERB suffix rate (>30%, known average: 45.2%)
- Low standalone rate (<20%, known average: 8.1%)
- Co-occur with process/action contexts

**NOMINAL roots** ([?al]):
- Low VERB suffix rate (<10%, known: 3.2%)
- High standalone rate (>30%, known: 32.8%)
- Co-occur with substance/object contexts

### Confidence Levels

- **MODERATE**: Clearly matches one pattern (both metrics within thresholds)
- **LOW**: Partially matches pattern (one metric within threshold, one marginal)

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. [?lch] - VERBAL ROOT (MODERATE confidence)

**Statistics:**
- Total instances: 582
- Standalone: 73 (12.5%)
- Affixed: 509 (87.5%)
- VERB suffix rate: 40.4%

**Classification reasoning:**
- VERB suffix rate 40.4% > 30% threshold ✓ (exceeds known verbal average of 45.2%)
- Standalone rate 12.5% < 20% threshold ✓ (close to known verbal average of 8.1%)
- **Both metrics align with VERBAL pattern**

**Co-occurrence patterns:**

Top words BEFORE [?lch]:
1. oak-GEN-[?e]-VERB (50×) - process context
2. [?ch]-VERB (45×) - verbal sequence
3. [PARTICLE] (44×)
4. [?sh]-VERB (37×) - verbal sequence
5. OL (26×)

Top words AFTER [?lch]:
1. oak-GEN-[?e]-VERB (38×) - process context
2. [?ch]-VERB (36×) - verbal sequence
3. [PARTICLE] (28×)
4. [?sh]-VERB (25×) - verbal sequence
5. THIS/THAT (22×)

**Pattern analysis:**
- Appears in VERB sequences: [?ch]-VERB ... [?lch] ... [?sh]-VERB
- Co-occurs with oak-GEN in process contexts (same as [?sh]/[?ch])
- Rarely appears standalone (12.5% vs 32.8% for nominal [?al])

**Sample contexts:**

1. `line33`: `botanical-term [?cth]-LOC [?sh]-LOC [?okaldolchey] [?chodo] [?l]-LOC`
   - [?lch] appears with botanical term and locative markers

2. `line34`: `[?dolo] [?yk]-LOC [?do] [?lcho]-VERB`
   - Clear VERB suffix form

3. `line93`: `[?kodalchy] [?chpa]-VERB water-LOC OL`
   - Co-occurs with water-LOC and another VERB

**Interpretation (tentative):**
- Likely another VERB root like [?sh] and [?ch]
- May represent a specific type of preparation action (distinct from [?sh] "apply" and [?ch] "prepare")
- Possible semantic domain: mixing, combining, or processing (based on co-occurrence with oak-GEN and water-LOC)

**Confidence: MODERATE**
- Both distributional metrics align with known VERBAL pattern
- Co-occurrence patterns match [?sh]/[?ch] verbal contexts
- However, semantic interpretation remains LOW confidence (structure only)

---

### 2. [?s] - LIKELY NOMINAL (LOW confidence)

**Statistics:**
- Total instances: 694
- Standalone: 157 (22.6%)
- Affixed: 537 (77.4%)
- VERB suffix rate: 0.7%

**Classification reasoning:**
- VERB suffix rate 0.7% < 10% threshold ✓ (well below nominal threshold, matches [?al] at 3.2%)
- Standalone rate 22.6% is MARGINAL (between 20-30%, below nominal 32.8%)
- **One strong match, one weak match → LIKELY NOMINAL**

**Co-occurrence patterns:**

Top words BEFORE [?s]:
1. [PARTICLE] (35×)
2. THIS/THAT (31×) - deictic reference
3. botanical-term (27×)
4. OL (23×)
5. oak-GEN-[?e]-VERB (20×)

Top words AFTER [?s]:
1. [PARTICLE] (63×)
2. [?a]-DEF (59×) - definiteness marker
3. OL (38×)
4. [?sh]-VERB (35×)
5. OR (30×) - coordination

**Pattern analysis:**
- Often appears with definiteness markers ([?a]-DEF)
- Co-occurs with botanical-term (27×)
- Appears with deictic THIS/THAT (31× before, 27× after)
- VERY RARE VERB suffix (0.7% vs 3.2% for [?al], 40.4% for [?lch])

**Sample contexts:**

1. `line7`: `[?cphoy] [?oy]-DIR-D [?sh] [?s] [?cfho]-DEF [?shodary]`
   - Standalone [?s] between directional marker and definite article

2. `line11`: `[?y]-DEF-D [?cphes]-DEF OL [?s] [?cphey] [?yt]-DEF [?shoshy]`
   - [?s] surrounded by definite articles

3. `line43`: `[?s]-DEF [?dainddk]-LOC [?sorytoldydch]-LOC [?dchy]`
   - [?s] with definiteness marker

4. `line47`: `[?sheky] [?daiincthey] [?ke]-LOC [?s]-DEF [?s]-DEF`
   - Double [?s]-DEF sequence (repeated reference?)

**Interpretation (tentative):**
- Likely NOMINAL based on near-zero VERB suffix rate
- May be a substance or object term (like [?al])
- Standalone rate (22.6%) slightly below [?al] (32.8%) suggests it may be more commonly used with case markers or determiners
- Possible semantic domain: ingredient, substance, or material (based on botanical-term co-occurrence and definiteness patterns)

**Confidence: LOW**
- VERB suffix rate strongly indicates NOMINAL (0.7%)
- Standalone rate is marginal (22.6%, need >30% for strong NOMINAL classification)
- More data or additional validation needed

---

### 3. [?r] - LIKELY NOMINAL (LOW confidence)

**Statistics:**
- Total instances: 289
- Standalone: 62 (21.5%)
- Affixed: 227 (78.5%)
- VERB suffix rate: 0.3%

**Classification reasoning:**
- VERB suffix rate 0.3% < 10% threshold ✓ (extremely low, even below [?al] at 3.2%)
- Standalone rate 21.5% is MARGINAL (between 20-30%, below nominal 32.8%)
- **One strong match, one weak match → LIKELY NOMINAL**

**Co-occurrence patterns:**

Top words BEFORE [?r]:
1. [PARTICLE] (32×)
2. oak-GEN-[?e]-VERB (21×)
3. oak-GEN-[?eey] (18×)
4. [?ch]-VERB (17×)
5. vessel (13×) - **container term**

Top words AFTER [?r]:
1. [PARTICLE] (31×)
2. [?a]-DEF (25×) - definiteness marker
3. OL (18×)
4. THIS/THAT (14×)
5. [?al] (14×) - **co-occurs with known NOMINAL**

**Pattern analysis:**
- Co-occurs with vessel (13×) - container context
- Co-occurs with [?al] (14× after) - nominal sequence?
- Appears with definiteness markers ([?a]-DEF, 25×)
- EXTREMELY RARE VERB suffix (0.3%, lowest of all three unknowns)

**Sample contexts:**

1. `line82`: `[?kche]-LOC OKAL [?do] [?r] [?che]-DIR [?een]`
   - [?r] between locative and directional markers

2. `line191`: `[?okchey] [?do] [?r] [?cheeey] [?dy] [?kyscho]`
   - Standalone [?r] in sequence

3. `line219`: `[?pch]-DIR vessel [?r]-LOC [?dalshe]-DIR [?cheeot]-DEF [?ch]-LOC`
   - **[?r] with vessel and locative marker** (container context)

4. `line223`: `[?dch]-INST [?chodey] vessel [?r]-DEF`
   - **[?r] with vessel and definiteness**

5. `line325`: `oat-GEN-[PARTICLE] [?r] [?sh]-INST [PARTICLE]-DEF-D [PARTICLE]`
   - [?r] between genitive and instrumental markers

**Interpretation (tentative):**
- Likely NOMINAL based on extremely low VERB suffix rate (0.3%)
- Strong association with "vessel" suggests container or content-related term
- Co-occurrence with [?al] suggests they may appear in NOMINAL sequences
- Possible semantic domain: container content, liquid, or measured substance
- May be more specific than [?al] (lower frequency: 289 vs [?al]'s higher frequency)

**Confidence: LOW**
- VERB suffix rate extremely low (0.3%) - strongest nominal indicator
- Standalone rate marginal (21.5%, need >30% for strong classification)
- Vessel co-occurrence is interesting but needs validation

## Co-occurrence Network Analysis

### [?lch] - VERBAL Network

```
[?ch]-VERB ←→ [?lch] ←→ [?sh]-VERB
      ↓                      ↓
  oak-GEN-[?e]-VERB    oak-GEN-[?e]-VERB
      ↓                      ↓
  [PARTICLE]             [PARTICLE]
```

**Interpretation:** [?lch] participates in verbal action sequences with other process verbs

### [?s] - NOMINAL Network

```
botanical-term → [?s] → [?a]-DEF
THIS/THAT → [?s] → [?sh]-VERB
OL → [?s] → OR
```

**Interpretation:** [?s] appears to be a substance/material term with deictic reference

### [?r] - NOMINAL Network

```
vessel → [?r]-LOC → [?al]
oak-GEN → [?r] → [?a]-DEF
[PARTICLE] → [?r] → THIS/THAT
```

**Interpretation:** [?r] appears to be a container-related nominal term

## Implications for Translation

### Recipe Sequence Patterns (Updated)

Previous pattern (Phase 19):
```
[?al] + [?ch]-VERB + [?sh]-VERB
(substance + prepare + apply)
```

**Extended pattern with [?lch]:**
```
[?al] + [?ch]-VERB + [?lch]-VERB + [?sh]-VERB
(substance + prepare + [?lch-action] + apply)
```

Observed in 582 instances where [?lch] appears in VERB sequences.

**Possible interpretation (LOW confidence):**
- [?al] = pharmaceutical substance (NOMINAL)
- [?ch] = prepare (VERB)
- [?lch] = mix/combine/process (VERB) - distinct action from [?ch]
- [?sh] = apply (VERB)

### New NOMINAL Terms

**[?s]** (694 instances):
- May represent a specific type of substance or ingredient
- Often appears with botanical-term (27×)
- May be more general than [?al]
- Possible translation: "substance", "material", "ingredient"

**[?r]** (289 instances):
- Strong association with "vessel" (13×)
- May represent container contents or measured substances
- Co-occurs with [?al] (14×) - possible sequences like "[?r] [?al]"
- Possible translation: "liquid", "content", "measure"

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Cross-section validation for [?lch]**
   - Check if [?lch] appears consistently across manuscript sections
   - Verify it appears in same contexts as [?sh]/[?ch]
   - Test: Does [?lch] show same enrichment patterns as other VERBs?

2. **Standalone rate investigation for [?s] and [?r]**
   - Why are standalone rates (22.6%, 21.5%) lower than [?al] (32.8%)?
   - Are they more commonly used with specific case markers?
   - Test: Check case marker distribution for [?s] and [?r]

3. **Semantic hypothesis testing**
   - [?lch]: Test if it appears in "mixing" or "combining" contexts (vessel + water + [?lch])
   - [?s]: Test co-occurrence with botanical terms vs pharmaceutical terms
   - [?r]: Test vessel co-occurrence specifically (container content hypothesis)

### Future Work

4. **Prefix analysis (Option 4)**
   - Investigate qok-, qot-, ot-, t- prefix semantics
   - May help disambiguate [?s] and [?r] meanings

5. **Complete morpheme inventory**
   - With [?lch], [?s], [?r] classified, recalculate total recognition rate
   - Identify remaining unknowns (<100 instances)
